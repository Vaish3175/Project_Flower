Iris Flower Classification Project
The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is one of the most famous multivariate data set used for testing various Machine Learning Algorithms.Iris flower has three species namely setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
